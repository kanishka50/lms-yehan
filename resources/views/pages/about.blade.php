                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Cash Mind was founded in 2022 with a singular mission: to make financial education accessible to all Sri Lankans. We recognized a significant gap in the market â€“ while there were plenty of financial education resources available online, very few were tailored to the Sri Lankan context and presented in Sinhala.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Our founder, having experienced the challenges of navigating financial decisions without proper guidance, decided to create a platform that would empower Sri Lankans with the knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions and improve their economic well-being.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Since our launch, we have helped thousands of individuals across Sri Lanka gain valuable financial knowledge, develop income-generating skills, and take control of their financial futures.
